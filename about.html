<h2>Meeting people can be tough. Skout can make it a little easier.</h2>
<p>We are true believers in preserving the "magic" of serendipitous meetings and we make possible a wide range of social<br> connections from friendship to networking. With your mobile device as your guide, you can discover new friends at the<br> local neighborhood bar, at a concert at Madison Square Garden or on a bus tour in Barcelona. Our community spans <br> more than 100 countries and taps our app to meet new people nearby or continents away.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on connecting people through a platform that is fun and engaging. The Skout community thrives <br> because we focus on positive experiences and have zero tolerance for bad behavior. We make it easy to make new<br> friends thanks to features like chatting, photos and virtual gifts. The Skout community spans more than 180 countries<br> and is available in 14 different languages</p>
<h2>How we got started</h2>
<p>Skout Inc. was founded in 2007 to develop software products that take online social interaction further than anyone had<br> thought possible in the past. We wanted to create a community that would help mobile device users communicate better <br>with existing friends and business contacts, and to help connect them with new people nearby.</p>

<h2>Is Skout going to save the planet?</h2>
<p>Probably not. We just want to make it easier for people to find each other, have fun, and get to know someone better<br> before meeting them in person. ...But, since you're meeting people nearby, we might be saving you a car ride, which in<br> turn is good for the environment, so maybe in our own little way we are helping save the planet... Life is short, you are<br> busy and people are having fun without you right now. So start Skouting and find your party, anytime, anywhere.
